  <p>Iran's internet freedom is on life support, and the country has been building up to a government-controlled web for years.</p>
  <p>Similar to other regimes around the world, such as those in China and Russia, Iran has been centralizing network control since the turn of the millennium. The country announced its idea for a national internet in 2005, and since then it's been building new infrastructure, retrofitting the old, and heavily penalizing state internet service providers who step out of line.</p>
  <p>The rising price of oil lead to the latest crackdown in November after mass protests broke out in Tehran and other cities around the country. To squash the ballooning unrest, the Iranian government totally shut off citizen's access to the internet.</p>
  <p class="last">This crackdown marks the most wide-scale internet shutdown in the world. However, while the vast majority of Iranians couldn't get a signal, one city lit up in the dark.</p>

  <p>After the earthquake, Bam was destroyed: "Literally a rubble pile" said a U.S. relief coordinator, Bill Garvelink. With its infrastructure demolished, telephone and radio communications were cut off, and the power grid was severely damaged. Telecom providers confirmed that international calls were impossible.</p>

  <h3>Centralising power</h3>
  <p>Whatever the case in Bam, the rest of Iran was not so lucky. This is not the first time that the government has blocked online access to stop information from spreading. When there were mass protests in Iran in December 2017 and January 2018 following the elections, the government watched how stifling people's ability to communicate could also effectively stifle protests. In the past, Iran has also experimented with  bandwidth throttling, or blocking individual websites and apps, such as Facebook Instagram and Telegraph.</p>
  <p>Part of the reason Iran can even shut off the internet is because of its intranet, the National Information Network (NIN). With over $6 billion invested, the NIN is the most costly national telecommunications project in the history of the Islamic Republic.
  </p>
  <p>The national network means that even if Iran turns the internet off, it can still offer network access to essential services, such as banks, government offices and the like. The national plan has meant the rapid expansion of the country's fiber optic network. While Iran's fibre optic network looks similar to other country's, the government either wholly controls parts or has the ability to order telecoms, including ISPs and mobile data providers, to cut access.</p>

    <h2>Internet penetration in Iran</h2>
    <p>While Iranians' internet use appears to lag behind other Middle Eastern countries, its important to note that its population dwarfs its neighbors. Iran sits at 81.16 million people, with Saudi Arabia in a distant second with 32.94 million.
    </p>
    <p>
    An internet blackout would affect tens of millions. A joint report from Hootsuite entitled “Global Digital 2019" put the number of Iranian social media users at 47 million, or 57 percent of the population. A number that's not too far behind the 70 percent rate in the U.S.
    </p>
    <p>
    Before it was banned in April 2018, the most popular social media platform in Iran was Telegram, with 40 million users. Instagram reached 24 million users in the same timeframe, making Iran the seventh biggest market for the photo-sharing app.
    </p>
    <p>
    What happens next? Iran appears to believe that controlling the country’s online spaces is necessary for the survival of its regime. Many other countries seem to think the same. In September, Pakistan cut off internet access in some regions in response to protests, and India has done the same. Russia recently approved a bill that gives it the power to hamstring internet access if need be. The country even plans to run drills to ensure its blocks work when they are being used in live responses.
    </p>
    <p>
    Iran may be the country that currently holds the title for "biggest internet blackout," but for how long?
